# covid_housing_eda
Final project for DSE 6000

# Module for cleaning the data

This can be found in the plots.py file. It contains the necessary data cleaning and returns graphs to display on the dash application. 

# Module for Visualization

Though the plots.py returns the graphs, the actual module that takes care of the visualization and layout is in components.py.

# Running the application

The application is run and controlled by app.py.

# Correlations

All correlation analysis and queries can be found in the DSE_6000_Final_Project.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file. For easier viewing please visit [here](https://github.com/asrospie/covid_housing_eda/blob/main/DSE_6000_Final_Project.ipynb).

# Final Project Hosting

The dashboard created by this project is hosted on Heroku. [Here](https://dse-covid-housing-eda.herokuapp.com/) is the link for that. Please be patient while allowing the web worker to boot up (it will take up to a minute).
